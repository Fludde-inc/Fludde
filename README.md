## Overview
### Description

An application to share and review other opinions of contents such as books, music, movies that they have seen, read, or heard. Think Twitter meets Rotten Tomatoes. 

A user can follow other users. The user will be able to visit a home page timeline of reviews by those they follow, a search functionality that utilizes different API sources, and a user’s profile of their reviews.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking 
- **Mobile:** Mobile, first experience.
- **Story:** Allows users to share reviews on various content (ex. movies, music, books).
- **Market:** Anyone who views content and wants to share their opinion with others.
- **Habit:** Users can use this application as a journal to leave behind their overall review or initial thoughts while experiencing content. Users can explore their friends’ or influencers’ thoughts on content they have viewed.
- **Scope:** Fludde would start with a basic interface of viewing feeds and a user profile. We are only focusing on movies, music, and books, we can see this expanding towards TV shows, comics, video games, live performances, ect. After this, we could see a recommendation algorithm being added to the application along with adding pictures/videos to reviews. You can create lists of content that you can share with friends or like minded individuals.
